## React: Functional Components and Hooks

The main goal of this project is to practice React functional components and hooks by developing a memory game that allows users to test their memory skills.

### Features

- Cards are shuffled after a card click (Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm)
- Real time update of current score and best score
- If the same card is clicked twice, a game over screen displays the final score and best score
- The user receives a congratulatory message after finishing all the deck cards
